# potential_customer_revenue_with_rule_based_classification
In this project, potential customer revenue was calculated using rule based classification. The data set includes the prices of the products sold by an international game company and various demographic information about the users who buy these products. The records created after each sales transaction constitute the data set. Within the scope of the project, new level-based customer definitions were created and segments were created accordingly. By using the segments created, it was estimated how much revenue potential customers would bring to the company on average.
